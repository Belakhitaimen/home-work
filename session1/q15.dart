/**What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it
impact the way variables are used? */

/** if we define a variable with an unknown type or without a dart type
 *  dart will throw an error at compile time before running the code it means 
 * dart checks the variable types at compile-time So we can say Dart is a 
 * statically typed programming language where variable types are known at 
 * compile-time in dart. */
